## DSA-in-C repo
A repository for DSA in C programming language. 

---

### Why C, though?
Because C is the foundation (literally the base building block). It teaches you how memory works, how pointers behave, and how data structures function under the hood. If you can do DSA in C, you can do it in any language.

### Purpose
Hello there! I created this repository because when I was learning DSA in C, I couldn't find a single place that had all the programs I needed. I had to jump between 2-3 different repositories to put it all together, so I decided to build something that I wish I had access to: a clean, complete, and easy-to-understand collection of DSA programs written in C.
